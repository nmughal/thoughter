This is a TIY assignment practicing to write asynchronous tests for DOM manipulation and Ajax calls. We'll set up an HTML fixture for a test and use a fake server for Ajax testing.

This project also sets up process automation using Grunt, which includes adding tasks to Grunt and getting configuration setup and running.

Tests and build process by Nadia Mughal.
